I currently have a PhD in mathematical modeling, with a specialty in Probability and Statistics, which is why I have knowledge of data analysis and exploration. All my applications carried out during my stay in master's and doctorate were focused on the area of machine learning, inferential statistics, descriptive statistics and probabilistics theory.

Currently, I study about deep learning and reinforcement learning.
